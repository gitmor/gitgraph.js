<h2> Notes</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Feature branches branch off of 
        <b><i>master</i></b> 
        & merge back into 
        <b><i>master</i></b> 
    </li>
    <li>Release branches fork/branch off of 
        <b><i>master</i></b> 
        & never merge back into 
        <b><i>master</i></b> 
    </li>
    <li>The intent of Release branches is to freeze code & fallback point if hotfixes required
        without including all the changes that happened in master since it was released. 
    </li>
    <li>The bugs are usually fixed im master branch and cherry pick fixes to release branch as needed .  
        For complex & high risk bugs, fix done in release branch & an issue created to fix it properly 
        on master at a later date.
    </li>
    <li>Patch releases are created from release branches.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2> Pros</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There is only one eternal, canonical branch: master.</li>
  <li>Stable Mainline Model used by many firms.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Cons</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Might be problematic if long lived feature branches.</li>
  <li>All branches should periodically rebase with master to be up-to-date with developments in master branch.</li>
  <li>Might be problematic to merge if release cycles are long, not periodically rebased with master and same mature code base is changed/refactored extensively between releases along with personnel turnover.</li>
</ul>
